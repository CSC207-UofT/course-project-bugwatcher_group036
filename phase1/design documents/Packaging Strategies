packaging strategies
Our project can be divided into two parts according to its function.(Uno part and login part).
We did not spend so mush time on deciding our packaging strategy(Layers strategy).
From the very beginning we noticed that Clean Architecture is a very significant part of this course,
so we choose layers strategy for both parts whose layout of files is straight forward.
It makes us easier to implement the Clean Architecture and checkout the correctness afterwards.
