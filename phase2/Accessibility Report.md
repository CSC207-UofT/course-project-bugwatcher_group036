## Principle of Universal Design ##

| Principle of Universal Design | Example |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| Equitable Use                 | In phase 2 we implement a login system which is free to all users.In order to ensure privacy and safety,we allow user to set up their own account and password.UNO itself is a world-famous Board game.We believe our programme(with very clean and straight forward GUI design) appeal to all beginners who want to getting familiar with this game.        |
| Flexibility in Use            | We provide two mode of game(PVP and PVE).We implement GUI instead of command line.Buttons for card play are big to ensure they are easy to press for all users,and all labels with important information are clearly displayed,accommodate all user with different pace. |
| Simple and Intuitive Use      |Our GUI design just some how followed this principle,but we still think we need to do something more.So far our to play our game,user still need a basic English skill.The most important information(last played card) is displayed by a remarkable picture.During the game a reminder is also set to tell the card you draw,and after task completion we implement a “Game statistic” for each account to record some information while playing game(only PVE mode).Future:we want to change the display of play card button.Pictures should be more straight forward,and easier understand by people with different language skills |
| Perceptible Information       |The most important information(last played card) is displayed by a remarkable picture.Also,we display information in different colors so that users can easily distinguish different information.During the game a reminder is set to tell the card you draw.The guidance of registration also described clearly      |
| Tolerance for Error           |If an non-registered user tries to login, there would be message that would pop up saying that the username is incorrect.The button for card play,if the the card is not playable,the correspond button is also not clickable|
| Low Physical Effort           | As mentioned above,our program is easy to use,only need to input username and password.While playing,users only need to click buttons.|
| Size and Space for Approach and Use | Only need users to click button,and our layout of GUI can ensure a clear line sight for any seated or standing users.|

## Potential Customers for our Project ##
Our market target are beginners of this game(UNO) who want to get familiar with the rules and the game process.We also provide a simple PVP mode to appeal some consumers who wants to play UNO with friends(without physical cards).

## Is our project less likely to be used by a certain demographic? ##
Yes,although UNO is a world famous board game,there still exist some group of people not interested in it.We only provide a game with all basic rules and functions,but still hard to attract people without interest.
