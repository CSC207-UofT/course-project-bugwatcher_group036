## Purpose of our project
In one sentence, we want to write a java project that **simulate Board-Game "UNO"**, and add a few innovative features into it.

The Board-Game "UNO" is basically a card game. Each game contains 2 or more players. There are two different types of cards: the number card and function card. Each number card contains a number with a color and a function card contains a function and color. Each player will randomly receive 7 cards at the start of the game. Player that moves first in the game will randomly chose a card from his/her own player's hand and play one of the card. The remaining players will then take turns to play a card from the player own player's hand. Each player can only play a card in a turn from its own hand with the play card has the same color, number, or is a function black card as the last card played by the previous player. Each player will draw a card from the card deck if there is no card available to play in the round. The last card play from a player needs to be a number card and cannot be a function card. When a player has only one card, the player must say "UNO!" to inform others that there is only one card in the player's hand, otherwise the player needs to draw an extra card if other player notice. When a player have no more cards in the player's hand, the player will become the winner of the game.

We want to demonstrate our understanding of clean architecture and design pattern, by implementing them in this project. We also intend to enter the field of GUI design, client platform, login system, URL,
+-and AI training alongside developing this project. More importantly, we want to create a personalized game that involves our own innovative features and rules, and we aim for perfect.
