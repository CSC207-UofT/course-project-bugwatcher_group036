In one sentence, we want to write a java project that **simulate Board-Game "UNO".** 

Starting from implementing the UNO with basic setting and person-to-person on one computer, which is what we've accomplished throughout phase 0, 
we will gradually add more modes and settings to the game.

Our directions are mainly on these *three aspects*:
* **Optimizing basic settings**, including refining program structure and developing graphical User Interface to make it more user-friendly.
* **Implementing more rules**, like playing specific card would trigger special change, and adding extra function card into the deck.
* **Developing more game mode**, like UNO AI and player-to-computer mode, where player can choose number of computers. Moreover, we may develope remote game-mode (In the case that we have extra time).
